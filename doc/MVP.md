# MVP Demo - Automatic Deployment with ArgoCD

Welcome to the MVP demo for the "AsciiArtify" project! In this demo, we will showcase how ArgoCD, a GitOps continuous delivery tool, enables automatic deployment of the application from a Git repository to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Introduction

The "AsciiArtify" team has successfully completed the MVP deployment, which involved creating an application in ArgoCD to monitor the Git repository of the project located at [https://github.com/den-vasyliev/go-demo-app](https://github.com/den-vasyliev/go-demo-app). Automatic synchronization has been configured between the Git repository and the Kubernetes cluster using ArgoCD.

This MVP stage allowed the team to gather user feedback, implement additional features, and address any identified bugs or issues. Now, it's time to demonstrate the seamless integration between GitOps and continuous delivery with ArgoCD.

## Objectives

The objectives of this MVP demo are as follows:

1. Showcase the automatic deployment process facilitated by ArgoCD.
2. Highlight the application's functionality and features deployed using the ArgoCD infrastructure.

## Demo Steps

In this demo, we will perform the following step:

1. Showcase the functionality and features of the deployed application.

## Demo Video
